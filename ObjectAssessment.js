/*

For this assessment, download the file located here: http://goo.gl/EhXfQq

The file is a Javascript file (You can use SublimeText2 to open it!). 
In it, there is an object that is being declared using the Object Literal method. 
However, err.... there is a problem. Actually, lots of them. 
Your task this week is to clean up this object, making sure all the proper 
syntax and other needed components are included.

Once you have worked through the Object and corrected it, 
create an html file that pulls in the Javascript file and console logs out the object. 
Once you have completed that, check the project into GitHub under a repo called 'prime_prestudy_02'.


avengersMovie = {
    name : Avengers;
    runtime : 143 mins;
    releaseYear = 2012;
    "Director" : "Joss Whedon".
